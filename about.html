            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>Started with a few basic HTML tutorials in 2025, and now I'm building fully functional front-end layouts. I’ve spent the last year diving into bootcamps and workshops to move from 'beginner' to 'builder'.</p>

            <h3>Notable Strengths</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Organisation</dt>
                <dd>I focus on writing clean, semantic HTML that makes sense to both browsers and other developers. I like the challenge of taking a messy design and turning it into a logical, accessible structure.</dd>

                <dt>Persistence</dt>
                <dd>I enjoy the process of turning a static design into a fluid, responsive layout that looks great on any screen, from a phone to a desktop.</dd>
